# Welcome

let's build at the speedlight full-stacked webapps including AI with sweetheart

## *forword*

Sweetheart provides a supercharged heart for the non-expert hands. It makes programming a joy for many purposes keeping high performances including AI and **best coding practices**. All of that is possible due to the hudge capabilities of the *python* and *html/css* languages.

Sweetheart comes with highest quality programming components intensively used by GAFAM and others in a ready-to-use way even for newbies. Learn here how such tools can incredibly support you. Let's start with sweetheart, and **become skilled in what could help you in the everyday life and for a long time**.

## Why sweetheart ?

### sweetheart helps you getting coding full power from scratch

- easy to learn, easy to use
- full documentation provided
- built-in reponsive user interfaces
- quick and clean prototyping
- quick and clean deployment
- ready for maintenable great code quality
- ready for datacenters, big-data and AI
- ready for inovation and creativity

### sweetheart makes you skilled in relevant topics only

It exists many softwares, many libraries written in many coding languages. Obviously the IT possibilities are today a deep and limitless ocean. Maps,compas and experience are required to keep the right direction! Under the hood sweetheart aims doing this for you in a supported long term view: it comes with greatest components which are versatile enough, powerfull enough, quality enough, established enough, documented enough, future-oriented enough for coding.

**Furthermore sweetheart supports you for being fully focused on matters in which you are interested for, not more.**

These are definitely why sweetheart is python/html/css centric.

### sweetheart speeds-up deployment

Since the ubuntu operating system can be installed as usual softwares within Windows 10, it provides an incredible way for any organization to develop, administrate and deploy powerfull responsive webapps on its own local network keeping high capabilities of integration with the already existing tools like databases, MS-Excel, and SAP. Sweetheart offers you to drasticaly save time for this task.

## Learn Python

Python is a language widely used through the world and for well-known webapps like Instagram, Youtube or even within the Hubble spatial telescope. This is currently the most used coding language together with *javascript*. Believe there are many consistent reasons of that.**Intending to learn a programming language for first time coding, you have to learn python without any doubts**.

Have a look of what could be your first webapp running with python. Look how clear and clean it is. These so simple lines could be really powerfull! Dive into python for understanding how fast and amazing is the code hereafter.

``` python
import sweet

def welcome():
    """render a welcome message"""
    return sweet.html()

sweet.quickstart(welcome)
```

## Learn Html/Css

Since user interfaces are supposed to be adapted to many size of screens (this capability is called *responsive*) and knowing grand efforts engaged right now by GAFAM with regards to web and smartphone interfaces, one possibility is to consider first and from far: build user interfaces using html/css/javascript. Let's talk about javascript later, you can do a lot without considering it, and look how designed your first user interface with *html* and *css*. Why both? Simply because there are made to work together.

``` html
% rebase("sweet.HTML")

<div class="txtcenter">
  <h1>Welcome !</h1>
  <p>get coding full power at the speedlight</p>
</div>
```

This html snipet works perfectly within a webbrowser when rendered by the previous python script. So sweetheart support you behind the first line including valuable resources for getting started with simplicity and avoiding extra technical efforts.

## Run Ubuntu/Wsl

After getting first recommended knowledges, this is time to learn how run a webapp. Sweetheart offers you to drasticaly save time for this task. But before all, we have to install it and run it for getting ready-to-use features.

As a point, it requires to run a webserver by one side, and to run a database server ready for high-performances by another side. These kind of servers, and some others main components too, will be much better handled and deployed using the *ubuntu* operating system. Don't worry if your are not aware about the linux world, ubuntu can be installed directly within Windows 10 as any other software through the Windows Store, thanks to the Microsoft efforts! Open the Windows Store and install *Ubuntu 20.04 LTS*, the last stable release for production. In the same time, look for installing *VS Code* and *Terminal*, these are nice open-source tools provided by Microsoft too that we can highly recommand.
