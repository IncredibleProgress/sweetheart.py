## Code examples

### your first standalone webpage controller written in Python

``` python
# changes in progress
```

### your first *sweet* Html webpage including a bit of KNACss

``` html
<!-- changes in progress -->
```

## Install and run sweetheart

On *Windows 10* you have first to open the *Windows Store* for installing **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** and the **Windows Terminal**. Due to a current issue while accessing *localhost*, this is recommended to use [**Wsl1**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#set-your-distribution-version-to-wsl-1-or-wsl-2) and not Wsl2. Look at the [Microsoft Wsl documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions#accessing-network-applications) for getting an overview of differences.

Generally speaking sweetheart runs on *Ubuntu 20.04 LTS*. It will work on other Linux OS but it will require in this case some manual tasks for installing the usefull dependencies.

Opening an Ubuntu terminal, the 3 following lines will do for you all what is needed:

``` sh
# changes in progress
```

Main resources are now located within the `/opt/sweetheart` directory. Have a look on it could help you later for quicker understanding of what is doing sweetheart under the hood.

Now start the standalone welcome webapp providing the documentation. With the given initial config the following command will work on *Windows 10* up-to-date, *Windows Terminal* and *MS Edge* installed. In other cases omit the `--webapp` option and open manually the indicated url in any other webbrowser.

``` sh
# changes in progress
```

## Epilogue: a new incredible life starts now

Even at this early step, sweetheart allows you to make a lot by yourself. Enjoy discovering and learning how coding can help and support you, using amazing raw materials widely used by GAFAM and others!
