## Realistic code examples

Sweetheart allows you to do all what you need with only 1 Python file and 1 Html file, that's it! Even more, it leads you writting in a natural low-code and minimalistic way. Neithertheless under the hood it integrates the most powerfull and innovative features at the time being like Ubuntu, Rust, RethinkDB, Jupyter, TailwindCss and Vue.

### typical webpage controller written in Python

``` python
from sweetheart.sandbox import *

config = set_config({
    "webbrowser": "brave.exe",
    "selected_DB": "test" })

webapp = HttpServer(config, set_database=True).mount(
    Route("/", HTMLTemplate("grid.htm")) )

quickstart(webapp)
```

### typical Html webpage template

``` html
<!SWEETHEART html>

<python>
# some nice python code can be given here (many thanks to Brython!)
# SweetHeart preset also RethinkDB/WebSocket/Vue3 capabilities for you

def on_update(event):

    """ this updates in realtime RethinkDB using WebSocket 
        it should be called only from html event attributes
        e.g. <input type="text" id="row:col" v-on:keyup="update"> """

    elt = event.target
    
    r.table("grid")
    r.filter({"id": elt.tableId})
    r.update({elt.tableCol: elt.value})

def on_message(event):

    """ catch here WebSocket messages from the server side 
        you see, we handle directly the JavaScript event object """

    console.log(event.data)

def vue_created(data):

    """ this will be called as soon as the Vue3 instance is created
        it allows you fecthing data using ReQL before html rendering
        the data argument provides the $data object of the Vue model """

    r.table("grid").setVueAttr("table")

createVueApp({
    "table": [],
    "headers": ["col1","col2","col3"]
})
</python>

<div v-cloak id="VueApp" class="m-2">
  <h1 class="text-xl">Realtime Table</h1>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th v-for="h in headers" class="border">{{ h }}</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr v-for="n in table.length">
        <td v-for="h in headers" class="border">
          <input type="text" v-bind:id="tableId(n-1,h)" v-model="table[n-1][h]" v-on:keyup="update">
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

## Install and run Sweetheart

### set WSL on Windows 10

Discovering what is the WSL, have a look at the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). Then install *Ubuntu 20.04* via the Microsoft Store. At this step installing *VS Code* and *Windows Terminal* can be recommended to you too. When done click on Ubuntu within start menu, and now *Bash* is running!

### first steps with Bash

1. start setting the prerequisites
``` bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncredibleProgress/sweetheart.py/master/get-sweetheart.py | python3 -
```
You can suppress the `--rethinkdb` option if you don't need to setup the RethinkDB repository for Ubuntu/Debian.

2. then restart bash and get initial components
``` bash
bash
sws --init
```
Being experienced you can add extra python libs you want with `--init`. Typically you could prefer `fastapi` instead of simply `starlette`. Note too that JupyterLab is not set in too by default. This is because you could already use it by another way (e.g. within VS Code). If not you should also consider to install it with sweetheart as showed hereafter.

``` bash
# alternative examples for initial setting of sweetheart
sws --init jupyterlab
sws --init fastapi
sws --init fastapi jupyterlab
```

3. at last run sweetheart for tests
``` bash
sws start
```

There is here no heavy installation process which could badly interact with the operating system. Everything goes and runs safely within dedicated */home* directories. [Click-here]() for detailed informations.

### get power with many additionnal resources

``` bash
# interested for calculation, machine-learning, ms-excel
sws install science

# interested for processing or scraping the web
sws install web
```

## Epilogue: a new life starts now

Even at this BETA stage, Sweetheart allows you to make a lot by yourself. Enjoy discovering and learning how coding can help and support you, using amazing raw materials widely used by GAFAM and others!
