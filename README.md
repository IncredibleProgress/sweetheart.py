## Code examples

### your first webpage controller written in Python

``` python
from sweetheart.sweet import quickstart
from sweetheart.heart import Route, HTMLResponse

quickstart( Route("/", HTMLResponse("<h1>Welcome!</h1>")) )
```

### your first *sweet* Html webpage

``` html
%rebase("HTML")

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>get coding full power at the light speed now</p>
</div>
```

## Install and run Sweetheart

### set WSL on Windows 10

Discovering what is the WSL, have a look at the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). Then install *Ubuntu 20.04* via the Windows Store. At this step installing *VS Code* and *Windows Terminal* can be recommended to you too. When done click on Ubuntu within start menu, and now *Bash* is running!

### first steps with Bash

``` bash
# set prerequisites
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncredibleProgress/sweetheart.py/master/get-sweetheart.py | python3 -

# then restart bash and get initial components
bash sws sweet --init

# at last run sweetheart enabling JupyterLab 
sws start --jupyter-lab
```

There is here no heavy installation process which could badly interact with the operating system. Everything goes and runs safely within dedicated */home* directories. [Click-here]() for detailed informations.

### get power with many additionnal resources

``` bash
# interested for calculation, machine-learning, ms-excel
sws install science

# interested for processing or scraping the web
sws install web
```

## Epilogue: a new life starts now

Even at this Beta-stage, Sweetheart allows you to make a lot by yourself. Enjoy discovering and learning how coding can help and support you, using amazing raw materials widely used by GAFAM and others!
