## Code examples

### your first standalone webpage controller written in Python

``` python
import sweet

def welcome():
    """render a welcome message"""
    return sweet.html()

sweet.quickstart(welcome)
```

### your first *sweet* Html webpage including a bit of KNACss

``` html
% rebase("sweet.HTML")

<div class="txtcenter">
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>get coding full power at the speedlight</p>
</div>
```

## Install and run sweetheart

On *Windows 10* you have first to open the *Windows Store* for installing **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** and the **Windows Terminal**.

Generally speaking sweetheart runs on *Ubuntu 20.04 LTS*. It will work on other Linux OS but it will require in this case some manual tasks for installing the usefull dependencies.

Opening an Ubuntu terminal, the 3 following lines will do for you all what is needed:

``` sh
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install sweetheart
python3 -m sweet --init
```

Main resources are now located within the `/opt/sweetheart` directory. Have a look on it could help you later for quicker understanding of what is doing sweetheart under the hood.

Now start the standalone welcome webapp providing the documentation. With the given initial config the following command will work on *Windows 10* up-to-date, *Windows Terminal* and *MS Edge* installed. In other cases omit the `--webapp` option and open manually the indicated url in any other webbrowser.

``` sh
sweet start --webapp
```

## Epilog: a new incredible life starts now

Even at this early step, sweetheart allows you to make a lot by yourself. Enjoy discovering and learning how coding can help and support you, using amazing raw materials widely used by GAFAM and others!
